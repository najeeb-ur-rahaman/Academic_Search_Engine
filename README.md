# Academic Search Engines Project

## Project Overview
The **Academic Search Engines** project focuses on gathering academic data (such as articles and journals) from online academic sources and APIs. This data is then stored in an **Elasticsearch** database, which allows for efficient searching and retrieving of information based on user queries.

The project has two main components: **Frontend** and **Backend**. The backend is responsible for scraping data from academic websites, while the frontend enables users to search and view the results through a simple web interface.

## Key Features
- **Web Scraping:** The project scrapes academic content from websites such as [ERIC](https://eric.ed.gov/).
- **Elasticsearch Integration:** The project stores all scraped data in an Elasticsearch deployment to make it searchable.
- **User Search Functionality:** A web-based interface is provided, allowing users to search the collected data and view results.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two folders: **Frontend** and **Backend**.

### 1. Elasticsearch Setup
Before starting the project, you will need to create an account on **Elasticsearch** and set up a deployment to store and retrieve the data.

- **Elasticsearch Account Setup:**
  - Go to [Elasticsearch Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/).
  - Create an account and start a new deployment.
  - Save the deployment URL, username, and password as they will be required to connect to Elasticsearch from the project.

### 2. Frontend

The frontend is a basic web application built using **Flask**, a lightweight Python web framework. It allows users to search for academic content and view the results.

#### Files and Folders:
- **app.py:** 
  - This file sets up the Flask web application. It handles user queries and returns results from Elasticsearch.
  - It defines routes for the home page (`index.html`) and the results page (`results.html`).

- **Templates Folder:**
  - Contains HTML templates used to display the web pages.
  - **index.html:** The homepage where users can enter search queries.
  - **results.html:** Displays the search results returned by Elasticsearch based on the user’s query.

- **es_connection.py:** 
  - This file establishes a connection to Elasticsearch.
  - It retrieves the data from the database based on the user query and sends it to `app.py` for display.

### 3. Backend

The backend is responsible for scraping academic data from websites and storing the data in Elasticsearch for future search queries.

#### Files and Folders:
- **Crawl Engine Folder:** 
  - This folder contains all the code related to web scraping. 
  - **crawl_spider.py:** 
    - This file is the main web scraping script that uses a spider to crawl the [ERIC website](https://eric.ed.gov/) for academic articles and journals. 
    - The script collects relevant data like article titles, authors, and publication dates.

- **es_connection.py:**
  - This file is used to establish a connection to the Elasticsearch deployment.
  - It inserts the scraped data from `crawl_spider.py` into the Elasticsearch database.

## How It Works

### 1. Data Scraping
- The web scraping process is done by the **Crawl Engine** in the backend.
- The spider in `crawl_spider.py` crawls the ERIC website, collecting academic articles and journals. 
- This data is cleaned and prepared for storage in Elasticsearch.

### 2. Data Storage
- The `es_connection.py` file (in the backend) connects to Elasticsearch using the credentials provided during the Elasticsearch setup.
- It inserts the scraped data into the database, where it is indexed and ready for search queries.

### 3. User Search
- On the frontend, users can enter search queries on the home page (`index.html`).
- The query is sent to the Elasticsearch database via the `es_connection.py` file (in the frontend).
- Elasticsearch searches its indexed database for relevant academic articles matching the user's query.
- The search results are displayed on the `results.html` page.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Software Requirements
To run the project, you will need the following:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Elasticsearch Cloud Account** (for storing data)
- **Flask** (for the web interface)

### 2. Python Libraries

### 3. Set Up Elasticsearch
You need an Elasticsearch account and deployment to store and retrieve the academic data.

- **Create an Elasticsearch Account:**
  - Sign up at [Elasticsearch Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/) and create a new deployment.

- **Configure Elasticsearch Connection:**
  - Update the `es_connection.py` files (located in both the frontend and backend folders) with the deployment URL, username, and password obtained from Elasticsearch.

### 4. Configure Web Scraping
Before running the scraping process, ensure that the web scraping configuration is correct.

- **Update Scraper Settings:**
  - In the `crawl_spider.py` file, configure the spider to correctly scrape the desired academic website (e.g., ERIC). Adjust any settings or parameters needed for scraping.

### 5. Run the Web Scraping
Execute the web scraping script to collect academic data and insert it into Elasticsearch.

- **Run the Scraping Script:**
  - Use the `crawl_spider.py` file to initiate the scraping process. This script will gather academic data and push it to Elasticsearch.

```bash
python crawl_spider.py
```

### 6. Run the Web Application
Once the data is in Elasticsearch, you can start the web application to allow users to search and view results.

- **Start the Flask Application:**
  - Run the `app.py` file in the frontend folder to start the Flask web server. This will host the web pages where users can enter search queries and view results.

```bash
python app.py
```

### 7. Access the Web Application
Open a web browser and navigate to the local server address provided by Flask (typically `http://localhost:5000`) to interact with the search engine.

## Usage

### 1. Performing Searches
- **Homepage:**
  - Go to the homepage (`index.html`) where you can enter search queries related to academic articles or journals.

- **View Results:**
  - Submit your query, and the results will be displayed on the results page (`results.html`). The page shows a list of relevant academic articles based on your search.

### 2. Viewing and Analyzing Data
- **Search Results:**
  - The results page provides information on the academic articles, including titles, authors, and publication details. You can use these results to find relevant academic content.

## Conclusion

# Future Work for Academic Search Engines Project

## 1. Expand Data Sources
Currently, the project scrapes data from a single source, [ERIC](https://eric.ed.gov/). Future work could include:
- **Multiple Data Sources:** Add more academic websites and APIs (e.g., **Google Scholar**, **PubMed**, **JSTOR**, etc.) to diversify the data.
- **API Integration:** Instead of relying solely on web scraping, integrate more APIs (if available) for reliable and structured data retrieval.
- **Automated Data Updates:** Implement scheduled crawlers that automatically update the Elasticsearch index with new articles and journals on a regular basis.

## 2. Improve Data Cleaning and Validation
To enhance the quality of the data stored in Elasticsearch, the following improvements can be considered:
- **Data Cleaning:** Apply more rigorous data cleaning techniques to handle duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent data.
- **Validation Pipelines:** Introduce validation pipelines to ensure only high-quality data gets inserted into Elasticsearch.
- **Text Normalization:** Normalize text data (e.g., removing stop words, stemming/lemmatization) for better search relevance.

## 3. Optimize Elasticsearch Indexing and Querying
As an Elasticsearch expert, several optimizations can be implemented to improve search performance and relevance:
- **Custom Analyzers and Tokenizers:** Use custom Elasticsearch analyzers to handle specific academic terminology and improve search accuracy.
- **Relevance Scoring:** Enhance the Elasticsearch search engine’s relevance scoring to prioritize more important or relevant academic papers.
- **Faceted Search:** Implement faceted search functionality, allowing users to filter results based on categories such as publication year, authors, or topics.
